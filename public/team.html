                                    <p>My name is Isla and I’m 15 years old. I got diagnosed with autism just a month ago. I’ve had mental health issues for several years and I continue to battle with them. Last year, a doctor suggested getting an autism assessment done because of my sensitivity to sounds, voice impressions, love for Rubik’s cubes, my unique art skills, and my unique sense of humor. Autism in girls is easily missed because it’s very different from autism in guys. Girls with autism tend to ‘mask’ with others around them. Meaning, instead of acting like the stereotypical autistic behavior, we learn to blend in with others around us. This caused many of my friends and family to question the diagnosis. However</p>

Landon is nonverbal but I haven’t lost hope that one day my son will be able to say I love you mom, but until those words are spoken my son makes sure he gives me random hugs and kisses throughout the day and wipes my tears when he knows mom not having such a good day. He’s a very smart and intelligent young man whose facial expressions tell it all and has the brightest smile in the world. Landon's journey is just beginning. He has great things coming in the near future for the autism community this will not be the last time you will see Landon's face.</p>

I always knew I was different from other people, but I couldn’t quite understand it until I was in middle school. Through middle school, some thought of me as a weirdo or freak, and so I thought my autism was a curse. I remember whenever I was down my parents would always cheer me up and say 'Nicky, don’t let others define who you are.' As I got older I realized it wasn’t a curse, it was my gift. Once I got up to high school, everyone treated me with compassion and kindness. To this day I always love watching movies. When I was a kid, every time I before I go to bed </p>

He didn’t talk and *would instead* always use my hand or pointed to what he wanted. Back then, I remember actually learning singing language to communicate with Nicholas. He also was very sensitive to loud noises and would cover his ears. Boy oh boy. My Nicholas has a come a long way. He talks up a storm now. He has adjusted to loud noises. Nicholas loves singing gospel songs, swimming, and cooking...especially sweet potatoes. Nicholas is currently doing online virtual school due to the pandemic but he likes that he still gets to see his other classmates on screen. </p>

He was born full term but due to a major health issue was in the NICU for 44 days, we were so scared we’d lose our baby boy. He is a fighter though and surprised us all by healing quickly!! Jakey is our last baby and has brought so much joy to our lives. He always makes us smile and even when he’s not being the best listener his kind little heart reminds him to be nice and he’s quick to apologize for his fault. Jakey is flourishing in school and loves math! Numbers and puzzles are his forte and he amazes us with the amount of information his little mind can retain! </p>

                                    <p>"South is 18 years old and was diagnosed with autism at age 3 and he is an extraordinary artist. He started creating small clay figures at the age of 2, a few months before we knew of his autism diagnosis. South didn't talk at the time but he "sang" or hummed tunes. One night my husband and I were trying to enjoy dinner in an Italian restaurant and he was having a meltdown. A waitress asked us if he would like some pizza dough, and as soon as the dough hit his hands, South made the "M" arch and started singing "Buh Buh Buh" from the @McDonalds jingle. He was distressed because he wanted to go to McDonald's!

                                    <p>"Lawrence has autism and is also a highly competitive swimmer with Team USA and has been on the National Paralympic Swim Team for over 3 years. He is currently ranked 3rd in the world in his best event (100 butterfly) and 13th in the world in his 2nd best event (backstroke). Lawrence is extremely athletic and has great attention to detail. It has been challenging convincing others that he deserves opportunities to engage with non-disabled peers because he is still lacking in the social skills department. Lawrence has handled these challenges very well because most days he does not focus on what other people think of him. </p>

                                    <p>"My daughter Luna was just recently diagnosed with ASD and I’m so very proud of her. She enjoys building things with blocks/legos, coloring, and dancing like a ballerina! The more I learn about autism, the more I understand her and the way she likes to communicate. Sometimes the days can be really stressful for all of us when it comes to adjusting to change but it’s so worth it. I’m so excited to learn more about autism and how I can help my little girl feel comfortable and succeed! She’s my best friend and the funniest person I know. I’ll love her and cherish her forever and after!" Luna's Mother, @qweenphoenix</p>
